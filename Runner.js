//section 4 : Problem Solving Approach
//// 19. Introduction to Problem Solving
// so we will take a set of steps to solve a problem
// the steps
//// first : understand the problem
//1. understand the problem
//explore concrete examples
//break it down
//solve/simplify
//look back and refactor

// Problem Solving Apporach:
// 1. Understand the problem
// 1.A Can I restate the problem in my own words
// 1.B What are the inputs that go into the problem
// 1.C What is the output? (what should be returned)
// 1.D can the outputs be determined from the inputs?

console.log("test")
